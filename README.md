# Automobile-Customer-Segmentation
This GitHub repository contains a project on customer segmentation for the automobile industry. The project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct segments and gain valuable insights for marketing and business strategies in the automotive sector.
The project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their demographics, purchasing behavior, and vehicle preferences. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of customer characteristics, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing campaigns, product offerings, and customer experiences accordingly.

Key Features of This Project:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The repository includes code and notebooks for exploring and preprocessing the automobile customer data. This stage involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Customer Segmentation Techniques: It provides implementation clustering algorithms. The clustering algorithms help identify meaningful customer groups based on similarities and differences in their attributes.
3. Visualizations and Insights: The repository showcases visualizations and reports that summarize the findings from the customer segmentation analysis. These visualizations help in interpreting the results and extracting actionable insights for decision-making.
4. Machine Learning Models: The project also includes the development and evaluation of predictive models for customer segmentation. These models can be used to predict customer segments for new or unseen data, enabling businesses to classify and target their customers effectively.
5. Documentation and Guides: The repository provides documentation and guides on the methodologies, algorithms, and techniques employed in the project. It helps users understand the project's workflow, reproduce the analysis, and apply the concepts to their own datasets.

By exploring this repository, you can gain knowledge and practical insights into customer segmentation in the automobile industry.

# Clustering K-Protoype
A clustering model is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity.

Clustering models are used to identify patterns and group similar data points together. Clustering can be used for a variety of tasks, such as segmenting customers into different groups, identifying outliers, and finding relationships between variables.

In this project, we apply the K-Prototypes clustering algorithm to segment customers in the automobile industry. The K-Prototypes algorithm combines the K-Means algorithm for numerical data and the K-Modes algorithm for categorical data. This allows us to consider both numerical features like age, height, weight, and income, as well as categorical features such as gender, race, religion, and marital status.

It works by assigning each data point to a cluster based on its similarity to the cluster's prototype, which is a combination of the mean of the numerical variables and the mode of the categorical variables. This allows it to identify clusters in datasets with mixed types of data, making it a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis.
